      <description>It was great to meet everyone in our first workshops at the end of January, where we explained the Story:Web co-design project further and how it might help us develop ideas for &amp;lsquo;museums of the future&amp;rsquo;. Before the workshop we&amp;rsquo;d asked everyone to find something online relating to an environmental issue they were concerned about. During the workshop we talked about these issues, which included deforestation, poaching, air and water pollution, the environmental impacts of energy generation, fast fashion and block-chain technology, and the often hidden plastics and pollutants in packaging and some musical instruments.</description>
