      <description>Sensemaker Objects In the &amp;lsquo;What if?&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; exhibition at the Great North Museum: Hancock, we asked you to describe three objects in three words. This is how the Museum&amp;rsquo;s keepers describe them. How well do the keeper&amp;rsquo;s descriptions match your words?
Object 1: The Whitburn Harpoon This harpoon was found on the shore at Whitburn. It was possibly washed up from the sea and is therefore, potentially, an object from Doggerland.</description>
