# Adding to Flourish Network Graph
1. Add or modify data in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Iyk3voSLDAvzRaGletm-YW36oY4hIbIfEUVemg5_MuU/edit?usp=sharing). The data is received from Google Form linked from storyweb.info page, but needs properly formatting once it has arrived. Contributions from the Mural diagram need manually entering.
2. Flourish only needs the data in the Links (all columns) and Points (just columns A-E) worksheets.
3. HTML for the Flourish pop-up content (Points, column D) needs formatting. See [Flourish Popups](#Flourish-Popups)  below.
4. Google Sheet > File > Download > Excel file.
