### How can we use museum objects to talk about climate action and other global issues?

Story:Web is an idea for how museum collections, images and sounds shared online, and people’s experiences could be connected to make sense of climate action and other issues. For example, a grey seal skull collected on the Farne Islands connects with sea level rise, habitat loss, seaside holidays, the changing diets of seagulls and much more...

### Help us turn Story:Web into something you can use on social media and in museums

We are looking for people aged 17-25 to take part in design workshops and online activities to develop Story:Web with us. Please register your interest below:

## More Information
Story:Web began as a winning entry for the ‘Reimagining Museums for Climate Action’ design competition. The idea was developed by a team from the Great North Museum: Hancock in Newcastle, Newcastle and Manchester Universities, and sound artist David de la Haye. 

An interactive demonstration of how Story:Web might work is on display at the Glasgow Science Centre until 12 November 2021 as part of COP26, the UN Climate Conference. 

We have now got funding to turn Story:Web into a working system, including a way of using Story:Web on social media and an interactive exhibit in the Great North Museum: Hancock.

### Is the project just about climate action?
No. Climate action was the topic of the design competition. However, there are other topics like biodiversity loss and social justice that the collections of the Great North Museum: Hancock relate to. We will begin with climate action and then explore other topics according to the interests and ideas of those who take part.

### Who can take part?
We're looking for people who:
* Are aged 18–24 of any background or experience;
*	Are passionate, creative thinkers, problem solvers, team players, curious, enthusiastic and responsible;
*	Live within reasonable travelling distance of Newcastle upon Tyne.

We also warmly welcome people who do not visit museums often. This includes, but is not limited to, young people who identify themselves as: LGBTQIA+; from working class backgrounds; neurodivergent; disabled; having a migrant or refugee experience; from African Diaspora; from South, East and South East Asian diaspora; and/or ethnically diverse. 

### How can I take part?
We will design the working Story:Web system in design workshops with a small number of participants, and online activities with a larger number of participants.

### What will happen in the workshops?
Workshops will include sharing how you currently use social media and discuss climate action and other issues, exploring how objects in the Great North Museum: Hancock’s collection relate to these issues, and experimenting with technologies like artificial intelligence and social media chatbots to make discovering and including collection objects in social media conversations easier.

### When and where will the workshops be?
There will be six workshops during the project, which will take place every month for the first 3 months (October-December 2021, then every two months for the next 6 months (January-June 2022).

Workshops will take place at the Great North Museum: Hancock or at Newcastle University, in central Newcastle. If COVID restrictions change, workshops will move online using Zoom.

Workshops will last between 2 and 3 hours and are likely to take place late afternoon or early evenings to fit with your work or studies. Occasional workshop activities may need to take place at other times, but we will check with you to find a time that works best.

Workshop places are limited and we need people to take part in all six workshops if possible. Participants will be offered £25 in shopping vouchers for each workshop they attend (£150 in total) to thank them for their time.

### What will happen in the online activities?
We will share the issues and ideas discussed in the design workshops online so that other people can discuss them and add their own contributions. There will also be some online activities exploring how museum objects, images and sounds could be used on social media, including using prototypes of the new Story:Web system as it develops.

### When and where will the online activities be? 
Online activities will take place in parallel and in between design workshops, and will be held on the social media platform(s) used most by those who register their interest.

We are unable to offer shopping vouchers to online participants due to the numbers involved.
