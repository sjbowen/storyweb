**Story:Web** explores what happens if we consider museum collections and publicly shared creative media as ‘big data,’ where objects, images, and sounds can be linked to tell the larger stories about climate change.

**Story:Web** was a finalist in the Reimagining Museums for Climate Action design challenge and will be exhibited at the Glasgow Science Centre from June to October 2021 on the lead up to COP26 (the UN Climate Change Conference).

Our starting point was a grey seal skull. Take a look and listen to how the [Story:Web is growing](/#storyweb) then share media (images, sound, text) that connect with it here:
