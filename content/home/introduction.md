Story:Web explores how museum collections, images and sounds shared online, and peopleâ€™s experiences could be connected to make sense of global issues like climate change.

An [interactive demo of Story:Web](https://storyweb.vercel.app/) was on show at the [Glasgow Science Centre](https://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/discover/our-experiences/remimagining-museums-for-climate-action) up to and during [COP26](https://ukcop26.org/), the UN Climate Change Conference, as part of the [Reimagining Museums for Climate Action](https://www.museumsforclimateaction.org/) exhibition.

During 2021 and 2022 we are developing Story:Web into a real digital system for use on social media and in museums, for people to discuss global issues like climate action. We need people aged 17-25 to help with this, [find out more here](/takepart).
