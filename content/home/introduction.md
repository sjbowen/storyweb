Climate change is complicated, and can often feel as if it is happening far away. However, itâ€™s part of our everyday lives, and the effects are all around us.  

**Story:Web** is a digital platform that tells stories around climate change using museum objects, sounds, images and words. 

We are growing **Story:Web** with your help, using the new 'story snippets' you share to take stories in different directions. Where might the journey take us? 

**Explore Story:Web** at the [Glasgow Science Centre](https://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/discover/our-experiences/remimagining-museums-for-climate-action) where it is on show as part of the [Reimagining Museums for Climate Action](https://www.museumsforclimateaction.org/) exhibition for COP26 until November 2021, and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/GrowStoryWeb).
