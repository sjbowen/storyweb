# Sensemaker Objects
In the 'What if?...' exhibition at the Great North Museum: Hancock, we asked you to describe three objects in three words. This is how the Museum's keepers describe them. How well do the keeper's descriptions match your words?

## Object 1: The Whitburn Harpoon

This harpoon was found on the shore at Whitburn. It was possibly washed up from the sea and is therefore, potentially, an object from Doggerland.  This is an area of land where the North sea now is, which  was submerged by rising sea levels in the Mesolthic.

**Keeper's Keywords:** one; two; three

## Object 2: Fossilised Fish
