# Sensemaker Objects
In the 'What if?...' exhibition at the Great North Museum: Hancock, we asked you to describe three objects in three words. This is how the Museum's keepers describe them. How well do the keeper's descriptions match your words?

## Object 1: The Whitburn Harpoon

## Object 2: Fish Fossil

## Object 3: Pipefish
