**How can museum collections help us have better conversations about environmental issues?**

By making connections with our everyday lives and interests without creating ‘echo chambers’ where everyone agrees, or painting everything in ‘black and  white’?

How could we do this both inside the museum and online?

How can young people start these conversations?

Young people aged 16-19 worked with us to explore answers to these questions. An exhbition at **the Great North Museum: Hancock** showcases the ideas we came up with. You can also take a look at the three ideas here on the Story:Web website. 

* [Idea #1: Story Inspiration Station](idea1/)
* [Idea #2: SenseMaker](idea2/)
* [Idea #3: EnviroAds](idea3/)

The ideas are also explained in this video, which is part of the exhibition:

[Tell us what you think about the ideas](https://forms.gle/5NzYU91baqTEgtCM9), and we'll use your feedback to work out what to build for the museum for real!
