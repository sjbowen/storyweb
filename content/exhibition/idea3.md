**People are already making and sharing short videos about environmental issues - including the 16-19 year old participants who worked with us.**

But, if you are not already looking for these videos, how would you find them?

Many aspects of our lives have environmental impacts, which we sometimes don't realise.

What if...
* When you’re looking at a website about something you’re interested in, a video appears in one of the advertising slots,
* Which explains an environmental issue relating to it?

Perhaps you’re looking for new music, and you get a video about sustainable guitars...

Perhaps you’re researching your next holiday destination, and you get a video about that country’s problems with animal poaching...


[Tell us what you think about this and the other ideas](https://forms.gle/5NzYU91baqTEgtCM9), and we'll use your feedback to work out what to build for the museum for real!
