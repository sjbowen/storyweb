**Every museum object can be a starting point for a story.**

Stories help us make sense of environmental issues like climate change, biodiversity loss, and food security.

But it can be hard to find an object to inspire your story.

## Story Inspiration Station
What if...
* A screen showed three objects at the push of a button,
* Either connected with an environmental issue or chosen at random.
* And you start a story inspired by one of these objects,
* That you can then share with others?

[Tell us what you think about this and the other ideas](https://forms.gle/5NzYU91baqTEgtCM9), and we'll use your feedback to work out what to build for the museum for real!

## Have a Go!
[Visit this web form](https://forms.gle/zLg1JLDUVMrjworJ8), pick an object, and start a story!
